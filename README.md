## Overview

Race Tracker is a specialized tool designed for amateur radio operators who provide communication support for trail races. When runners are spread across remote areas with limited cell coverage, radio operators at aid stations relay position updates to net control. This application replaces paper-based tracking systems with an intuitive digital kanban board that works completely offline.

**Key Features:**
- 🏃‍♂️ **Multi-course support** with swimlane layout
- 📱 **Offline-first** - works without internet connection
- 🎯 **Batch entry** for quick participant updates
- 📊 **Activity logging** with timestamps and distance tracking
- 🖱️ **Drag-and-drop** interface for individual moves
- 💾 **Browser storage** - no server required
- 📺 **Display-friendly** for public viewing screens

That's it! No installation, no server setup, no internet connection required.

## Event Setup Guide

### 1. Event Setup
Configure basic event information:
- **Event Name:** "Lost Turkey Trail Race 2024"
- **Date:** Race date
- **Location:** Race location
- **Description:** Optional event details

### 2. Aid Stations Setup
Define all aid stations for your race:
- **Default stations:** Start, Finish, DNF, DNS are included automatically
- **Custom stations:** Add your specific aid stations (e.g., "Burnt House", "Lost Children", "Hairpin")
- **Station names** should match what radio operators will use

### 3. Courses Setup
Create courses and define aid station sequences:
- **Course Name:** "50K", "Half Marathon", etc.
- **Aid Station Sequence:** Select stations in the order runners will encounter them
- **Distances:** Enter distances between stations (optional but recommended)
- **Multiple courses** can share the same aid stations

**Example 50K Course:**
```
Start → Skyline (8.6 mi) → Burnt House (8.3 mi) → Lost Children (6.6 mi) → Hairpin (3.5 mi) → Finish (4.0 mi)
```

**Example Half Marathon:**
```
Start → Lost Children (5.7 mi) → Hairpin (3.5 mi) → Finish (4.0 mi)
```

### 4. Participants Setup
Add participants and assign them to courses:
- **Individual Entry:** Add participants one by one with ID, name, and course
- **Bulk Entry:** Paste comma-separated participant IDs
- **Course Assignment:** Each participant must be assigned to a specific course
- **Special Participants:** Add sweeps, crew, and other non-race participants

**Participant Types:**
- **Race participants:** Runners with bib numbers (e.g., "101", "102")
- **Other participants:** Sweeps, crew, volunteers (e.g., "50K Sweep", "Medical")

## Race Day Operations

### Race Tracker Interface
The main race tracking interface shows:
- **Course Swimlanes:** Each course gets its own horizontal section
- **Aid Station Columns:** Stations appear in course order
- **Participant Cards:** Show current location and course assignment
- **Status Stations:** DNF/DNS available to all courses

### Batch Entry
Click any station header to open batch entry:
- **Participants:** Enter comma-separated list (supports autocomplete)
- **Time:** Flexible format - "10:05", "1005", "2PM", "14:30"
- **Notes:** Optional message or details
- **Course Analysis:** Real-time validation with color-coded feedback

**Batch Entry Examples:**
```
Participants: 101, 102, 103, 50K Sweep
Time: 10:15
Notes: All runners looking good, requesting water resupply
```

### Drag and Drop
- Drag individual participant cards between stations
- Useful for single participant updates
- Maintains activity log automatically

### Activity Log
View comprehensive race activity:
- **Chronological listing** of all movements and messages
- **Distance calculations** based on course setup
- **Course analysis** showing progression validation
- **Export-ready format** for race officials

## Use Cases

### Typical Race Day Workflow

1. **Pre-race Setup:**
   - Configure event, stations, courses, and participants
   - Display on TV/monitor for public viewing
   - Test with radio operators

2. **During Race:**
   - Radio operators report: "Net control, Hairpin station, runners 101, 102, 103 arrived at 10:15"
   - Operator enters batch update via station header click
   - Participants automatically move from previous station to current
   - Activity log captures all movements with timestamps

3. **Race Monitoring:**
   - Visitors can view progress on display screen
   - Course analysis helps identify issues (wrong course, missed stations)
   - Activity log provides official record for race coordinators

4. **Post-race:**
   - Activity log serves as complete race record
   - Data remains in browser for future reference
   - Export capabilities for race officials (future enhancement)

### Multi-Course Races
Perfect for events with multiple distances using shared aid stations:
- **50K and Half Marathon** using same finish area
- **Different start times** with overlapping courses  
- **Separate swimlanes** prevent confusion between courses
- **Shared status stations** (DNF/DNS) for all courses

## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **No plugins required:** Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Mobile friendly:** Works on tablets and phones
- **Offline capable:** No internet connection needed

## Background

This application was developed for the amateur radio operators who support the Lost Turkey Trail Race and similar events. It replaces a modified version of nullboard (kanban board) that required manual drag-and-drop for every participant movement. The new system maintains the visual kanban interface while adding batch entry capabilities, multi-course support, and comprehensive activity logging.

**Times are estimates only.** Runners are often reported in 5-15 minute batches. Official timing is handled by race organizers at start/finish lines. This system provides general progress tracking for participants, supporters, and race coordination.
