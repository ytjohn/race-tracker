## Project Overview

This project is a portable, offline-first race tracking tool for amateur radio operators supporting trail races. The tool allows operators to quickly update runner locations at aid stations, log key events, and generate reports for race control. The primary interface is a Kanban-style board, with columns for each aid station and cards for each participant (bib number).

**STATUS: MVP COMPLETE ‚úÖ** - All core features implemented and tested. Project is race-day ready.

## Stretch Goals - SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ‚úÖ

### COMPLETED STRETCH GOALS ‚úÖ

- **‚úÖ Swimlanes/Multiple Courses**
  - Full multi-course support with separate swimlanes
  - Course-specific aid station sequences with distances
  - Visual separation and color coding

- **‚úÖ Activity Log Management**
  - Dedicated activity log page with chronological view
  - Distance calculations and course analysis
  - Comprehensive participant movement tracking

- **‚úÖ Participant Management**
  - Dedicated participants setup page
  - Course assignment and reassignment interface
  - Support for race participants vs. other participants (sweeps, crew)
  - Bulk participant addition with course selection

- **‚úÖ UI Enhancements**
  - Modern card-based design with hover effects
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Escape, Enter, Ctrl+Enter)
  - Responsive layout with horizontal scrolling
  - Auto-focus and improved form handling

- **‚úÖ Event Management System**
  - Complete event setup workflow (Event ‚Üí Aid Stations ‚Üí Courses ‚Üí Participants)
  - Event list management with switching between events
  - Event duplication and deletion
  - Default data loading from JSON templates

### PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED üîÑ

- **üîÑ Reporting/Export**
  - Activity log viewing implemented
  - CSV/PDF export: Not yet implemented (future enhancement)

- **üîÑ Estimated Arrival Windows & Overdue Flags**
  - Distance calculations implemented
  - Calculate once they reach first stop, update with each additional stop.
  - Overdue flagging: Not yet implemented (future enhancement)

### NOT YET IMPLEMENTED ‚ùå

- **‚ùå Sort participants in column by speed*
  - As pace is re-evaluated at each stop, move faster participants to top of card.
- **‚ùå Thermal Printer Support**
  - Would require additional browser APIs or native app wrapper

## Technical Implementation - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

- **‚úÖ Frontend:** Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS with modular architecture
- **‚úÖ Data Storage:** LocalStorage with structured data hierarchy
- **‚úÖ Portability:** Runs as static files in any modern browser
- **‚úÖ No backend required:** Fully self-contained application

### Architecture
- **Modular JavaScript:** Separate files for core functionality, navigation, event setup, race tracking, participants, activity logging, and event management
- **Data Hierarchy:** Event ‚Üí Aid Stations ‚Üí Courses ‚Üí Participants ‚Üí Activity Log
- **State Management:** Centralized data management with localStorage persistence
- **Navigation:** SPA-style routing with URL parameters
